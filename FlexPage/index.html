                Basketball is a popular sport that ranks in the top three among
                Olympic games. This year, the men's basketball gold medal at the
                Paris Olympics went to the United States. We went and are
                currently at 5 losses. However, unfortunately, our country did
                not participate. I couldn't do it.

                Tennis is a gentlemanly sport that ranks second in the top 2
                overseas. It is as popular as it is a famous sport. At this
                year's Paris Olympics, Serbia's Djokovic and China's Zheng
                Qinwen jointly won the championship.
